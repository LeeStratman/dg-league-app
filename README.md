Disc Golf is a rapidly growing sport. However, it is common to see disc golf leagues being managed through social media platforms like Facebook. This forces league organizers to collect scorecards for every event and manually calculate event and league results. Also, without a social media account, it can be difficult for players to find disc golf leagues to join. I created a MERN stack web application that allows users to search for and, if interested, join a disc golf league. Players can easily create scorecards, search for courses, search and join leagues, and view league schedules and results. Not only is the app for disc golf players, but it also supports the user becoming a league organizer by allowing league creation and management. League organizers can manage league details and add courses and events. Results are automatically calculated for the organizer when a player submits a scorecard for a particular event. Future iterations will include searching for leagues based on your location and adding different scoring rules such as player handicaps to make the leagues more beginner friendly.
